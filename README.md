# Yellow-Olive
### Motivation
An experimental attempt at gamifying Kubernetes, inspired by Pokémon, designed to re-ignite nostalgia while making Kubernetes concepts more engaging and approachable.

Learning Kubernetes can be overwhelming - the endless YAMLs, abstractions, and concepts can quickly become frustrating. I experienced this firsthand, failing my first attempts at CKAD and CKA due to gaps in conceptual understanding.

Project Yellow Olive is a small experiment born from that frustration - an attempt to rethink how Kubernetes is learned, and to help others who may be struggling with the same challenges.
