PROFESSOR_BALD_DIALOGUES="""Welcome, young engineer, to the world of Kubernetes.
I am Professor Bald Uncle.
Though many simply call me - The Kubernetes Prof.
This vast world runs on Clusters and Containers.
Some fear it.
Some attempt to tame it.
And a rare few seek to master it.
As for me?
I have devoted my life to studying Kubernetes.
And today onwards, your journey to the world of Kubernetes begins.
